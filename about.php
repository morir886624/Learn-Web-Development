      My background :          
      </h2>
      <p>
      My name is Abdul Moeid Morir. In Afghanistan, I studied medicine for two years, but due to the security situation, I had to leave my country. <br>  I've been in France for two years now, and here, I've decided to refocus my career on digital technology, a field that has always interested me. <br> Thanks to my current training, I discovered web development and began learning the basics of coding. <br> I'm still in the learning phase, but I'm very motivated to progress and build a new career path here in this field.
